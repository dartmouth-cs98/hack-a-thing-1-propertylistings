#Property Finder - React Native

###Description:
Since I had never worked with React Native in depth, and I potentially could be interested in app development for my project, I thought this was a good way to get familiar with it. I copied an online tutorial (link given below), and followed all the steps they had in there. The tutorial helped me build a property finder app for areas in UK. 

###What I learned:
This was a cool way to learn more about app development, and how to run the iOS stimulator on my computer. Furthermore, it gave me an ooportunity to use my previous JS skills to work on something new. Furthermore, this tutorial was very detailed and explained every new thing that was added to the code and what it did. 

###What didn't work:
Since most of React Native is built on Xcode and runs through Xcode, I struggled a lot to work with Xcode. It was hard to understand all the things that were running and building on Xcode, and I also struggled to work with console logging on it. As far as the tutorial was concerned, everything worked perfectly.
